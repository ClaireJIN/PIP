== PIP Image Processor ==

=== About ===

PIP stands for PIP Image Processor, which provides basic image processing interface for users.

It is a Digital Image Processing course project written in C++. (Previous versions contain C# and Java version, but C++ is currently used because it is required by DIP course.)

=== How you could help ===

Code review is a good way to improve my code and your skills. 

It is highly appreciated if you read my code and gave suggestions.
